# Welcome to my Readme

I will push here my advencement in the C++ courses and what seems to be important for me!



## LEVEL 1

###Compiler

###IDE
   >f12: definition </br>
   >f2: change name</br>
   >f5 + CTRL: run

###GIT
   >don't commit unworking code</br>
   >make clear phrases in the title of the commit

###Debugger
   >f9 -> put a breakpoint

###Formating Tool

###Static analyser
   >cppCheck to find errors

###Naming
   >try to be as clear and short as possible

###Stack/Heap
   >Heap is good for polymorphisme and huge objects. Stack seems to be preferable in the other cases in general

###consistency in style
   >Try to make everything similar and identifiable in a single project -> keep the same style.
