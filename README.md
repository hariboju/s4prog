# Welcome to my Advencements

I will push here my advencement in the C++ courses and what seems to be important for me!



## LEVEL 1

### Compiler

### IDE
   >f12: definition </br>
   >f2: change name</br>
   >f5 + CTRL: run

### GIT
   >don't commit unworking code</br>
   >make clear phrases in the title of the commit

### Debugger
   >f9 -> put a breakpoint

### Formating Tool

### Static analyser
   >cppCheck to find errors

### Naming
   >try to be as clear and short as possible

### Stack/Heap
   >Heap is good for polymorphisme and huge objects. Stack seems to be preferable in the other cases in general

### Consistency in style
   >Try to make everything similar and identifiable in a single project -> keep the same style.

---

## LEVEL 2

### Work, then good
   >Before trying to have the best and shorter code, make something that is working 

### Free functions
   >Better for the encapsulation of classes 

### Design cohesive classes
   >respect single responsability</br>
   >Prefer struct to class if ther are no invariants </br>

### Structs to group data
   >Designated initializers

### Small functions
   >as small as possible to make everything redable and dissociable

### Don't repeat yourself
   >Use the same functions for deferent things if it's possible, don't creat similar things

### Enums
   >use Enum class and not Enum

### Problems in small Pieces 
   >functions and class as simple and short as possbile </br>
   >Split huge tasks in different little tasks

### Composition over Inheritance
   >use polymorphism over inheritance
